      "explanation": "There are many ways to create objects in javascript as mentioned below:\n\n    1. **Object literal syntax:**\n\n       The object literal syntax (or object initializer), is a comma-separated set of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces.\n\n       ```javascript\n       var object = {\n         name: \"Sudheer\",\n         age: 34,\n       };\n       ```\n\n       Object literal property values can be of any data type, including array, function, and nested object.\n\n       **Note:** This is one of the easiest ways to create an object and it's most commonly used for creating simple, ad-hoc objects.\n\n    2. **Object constructor:**\n\n       The simplest way to create an empty object is using the `Object` constructor. Currently this approach is not recommended.\n\n       ```javascript\n       var object = new Object();\n       ```\n\n       The `Object()` is a built-in constructor function so \"new\" keyword is not required for creating plain objects. The above code snippet can be re-written as:\n\n       ```javascript\n       var object = Object();\n       ```\n       However, `Object()` can be used to either create a plain object or convert a given value into its corresponding object wrapper, whereas `new Object()` is specifically used to explicitly create a new object instance.\n       \n    3. **Object's create method:**\n\n       The `create` method of Object is used to create a new object by passing the specified prototype object and properties as arguments, i.e., this pattern is helpful to create new objects based on existing objects. In other words, this is useful for setting up **prototypal inheritance**. The second argument is optional and it is used to create properties on a newly created object.\n\n       The following code creates a new empty object whose prototype is null.\n\n       ```javascript\n       var object = Object.create(null);\n       ```\n\n       The following example creates an object along with additional new properties.\n\n       ```javascript\n       let vehicle = {\n         wheels: \"4\",\n         fuelType: \"Gasoline\",\n         color: \"Green\",\n       };\n       let carProps = {\n         type: {\n           value: \"Volkswagen\",\n         },\n         model: {\n           value: \"Golf\",\n         },\n       };\n\n       var car = Object.create(vehicle, carProps);\n       console.log(car);\n       ```\n\n    4. **Function constructor:**\n\n       In this approach, create any function and apply the new operator to create object instances. This was the main way to do constructor-based OOP before ES6 classes.\n\n       ```javascript\n       function Person(name) {\n         this.name = name;\n         this.age = 21;\n       }\n       var object = new Person(\"Sudheer\");\n       ```\n    5. **Function constructor with prototype:**\n\n       This is similar to function constructor but it uses prototype for their properties and methods. Using prototype means you're sharing methods/properties across instances, which saves memory and improve performance.\n\n       ```javascript\n       function Person() {}\n       Person.prototype.name = \"Sudheer\";\n       var object = new Person();\n       ```\n\n       This is equivalent to creating an instance with `Object.create` method with a function prototype and then calling that function with an instance and parameters as arguments.\n\n       ```javascript\n       function func(x, y, z) {\n        this.x = x;\n        this.y = y;\n        this.z = z;\n       }\n\n       var instance = new func(1, 2, 3);\n       ```\n\n       **(OR)**\n\n       ```javascript\n       function func(x, y, z) {\n          this.x = x;\n          this.y = y;\n          this.z = z;\n       }\n       // Create a new instance using function prototype.\n       var newInstance = Object.create(func.prototype);\n\n       // Call the function\n       var result = func.call(newInstance, 1, 2, 3);\n\n       // If the result is a non-null object then use it otherwise just use the new instance.\n       console.log(result && typeof result === 'object' ? result : newInstance);\n       ```\n\n    6. **Object's assign method:**\n\n       The `Object.assign` method is used to copy all the properties from one or more source objects and stores them into a target object. This is mainly used for cloning and merging\n\n       The following code creates a new staff object by copying properties of his working company and the car he owns.\n\n       ```javascript\n       const orgObject = { company: \"XYZ Corp\" };\n       const carObject = { name: \"Toyota\" };\n       const staff = Object.assign({}, orgObject, carObject);\n       ```\n\n    7. **ES6 Class syntax:**\n\n       ES6 introduces class feature to create objects. This is syntactic sugar over the prototype-based system.\n\n       ```javascript\n       class Person {\n         constructor(name) {\n           this.name = name;\n         }\n       }\n\n       var object = new Person(\"Sudheer\");\n       ```\n\n    8. **Singleton pattern:**\n\n       A Singleton is an object which can only be instantiated one time. Repeated calls to its constructor return the same instance. This way one can ensure that they don't accidentally create multiple instances."

Since Arrays are truthful values, negating the arrays will produce false: ![] === false\n      2. As per JavaScript coercion rules, the addition of arrays together will toString them: [] + [] === \"\"\n      3. Prepend an array with + operator will convert an array to false, the negation will make it true and finally converting the result will produce value '1': +(!(+[])) === 1\n\n      By applying the above rules, we can derive below conditions\n\n      ```javascript\n      (![] + [] === \"false\" + !+[]) === 1;\n      ```\n\n      Now the character pattern would be created as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n            s               e               l               f\n       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n       (![] + [])[3] + (![] + [])[4] + (![] + [])[2] + (![] + [])[0]\n       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n      (![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]] +\n      (![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]] +\n      (![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]] +\n      (![] + [])[+[]]\n      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n      (![]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[+[]]\n      ```\n\n363."

      "explanation": "The `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in an array but it mutates the original array. Let's take a simple example to demonistrate this case,\n\n     ```javascript\n     const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n     const newArray = originalArray.reverse();\n\n     console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n     console.log(originalArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n     ```\n\n     There are few solutions that won't mutate the original array. Let's take a look.\n\n     1. **Using slice and reverse methods:**\n        In this case, just invoke the `slice()` method on the array to create a shallow copy followed by `reverse()` method call on the copy.\n\n        ```javascript\n        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n        const newArray = originalArray.slice().reverse(); //Slice an array gives a new copy\n\n        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n        ```\n\n     2. **Using spread and reverse methods:**\n        In this case, let's use the spread syntax (...) to create a copy of the array followed by `reverse()` method call on the copy.\n\n        ```javascript\n        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n        const newArray = [...originalArray].reverse();\n\n        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n        ```\n\n     3. **Using reduce and spread methods:**\n        Here execute a reducer function on an array elements and append the accumulated array on right side using spread syntax\n\n        ```javascript\n        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n        const newArray = originalArray.reduce((accumulator, value) => {\n          return [value, ...accumulator];\n        }, []);\n\n        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n        ```\n\n     4. **Using reduceRight and spread methods:**\n        Here execute a right reducer function(i.e. opposite direction of reduce method) on an array elements and append the accumulated array on left side using spread syntax\n\n        ```javascript\n        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n        const newArray = originalArray.reduceRight((accumulator, value) => {\n          return [...accumulator, value];\n        }, []);\n\n        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n        ```\n\n     5. **Using reduceRight and push methods:**\n        Here execute a right reducer function(i.e. opposite direction of reduce method) on an array elements and push the iterated value to the accumulator\n\n        ```javascript\n        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n        const newArray = originalArray.reduceRight((accumulator, value) => {\n          accumulator.push(value);\n          return accumulator;\n        }, []);\n\n        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n        ```\n\n434."

It ensures that the variable name always points to the same memory reference. However, if the variable holds an object or array, the *contents* of that object can still be modified.\n     2. **`Object.freeze()`**: Prevents the modification of an object's properties. It makes the object immutable (you cannot add, remove, or change properties), but it does not affect the variable assignment itself (unless the variable is also declared with `const`).\n\n     **Example:**\n\n     ```javascript\n       // Case 1: Using const (Reassignment prevented, Mutation allowed)\n       const person = { name: \"John\" };\n       person.name = \"Doe\"; // ✅ Allowed: The object is mutable\n       console.log(person.name); // \"Doe\"\n\n       // person = { name: \"Jane\" }; // ❌ Error: Assignment to constant variable\n\n       // Case 2: Using Object.freeze (Reassignment allowed, Mutation prevented)\n       let profile = { name: \"John\" };\n       Object.freeze(profile);\n\n       profile.name = \"Doe\"; // ❌ Ignored (or throws TypeError in strict mode)\n       console.log(profile.name); // \"John\"\n\n       profile = { name: \"Jane\" }; // ✅ Allowed: 'profile' is declared with 'let'\n       console.log(profile.name); // \"Jane\""

      "explanation": "An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging all the letters of a different word or phrase exactly once. For example, the anagrams of \"eat\" word are \"tea\" and \"ate\".\n\nYou can split each word into characters, followed by sort action and later join them back. After that you can compare those two words to verify whether those two words are anagrams or not.\n\n```javascript\nfunction verifyAnagrams(word1, word2) {\n  return word1.split(\"\").sort().join(\"\") === word2.split(\"\").sort().join(\"\");\n}\nconsole.log(verifyAnagrams(\"eat\", \"ate\"));\n```"

      "explanation": "Javascript has a native method sort that allows sorting an array of elements in-place. It will treat each element as a string and sort it alphabetically. But if you try to sort an array of strings which has non-ASCII characters, you will receive a strange result. This is because characters with an accent have higher character codes.\n\nIn this case, the sort order of an array is ['Wann', 'Woche', 'wäre', 'wöchentlich'].\n\nIf you want to sort an array of string values which has non-ASCII characters in an ascending order, there are two possible options like **localeCompare** and **Intl.Collator** provided by ECMAScript Internationalization API.\n\n**localeCompare:**\n\n```javascript\nlet arr = [\"wöchentlich\", \"Woche\", \"wäre\", \"Wann\"];\nconsole.log(arr.sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b))); //['Wann', 'wäre', 'Woche', 'wöchentlich']\n```\n\n**Intl.Collator:**\n\n```javascript\nlet arr = [\"wöchentlich\", \"Woche\", \"wäre\", \"Wann\"];\nconsole.log(arr.sort(Intl.Collator().compare)); //['Wann', 'wäre', 'Woche', 'wöchentlich']\n```"

      "explanation": "This question is really showcasing how JavaScript mixes array reduction with low-level bitwise tricks. The code first uses .reduce() to turn the array into a single value by counting how many elements are odd, then an IIFE immediately kicks in and loops through the array again, shifting each number left by its index and XOR-ing it into the accumulator. The whole vibe is about understanding how reduction works for summarizing arrays and how bit shifting plus XOR can transform values in a way that feels mathematical rather than typical JS.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe questions provided in this repository are the summary of frequently asked questions across numerous companies.
