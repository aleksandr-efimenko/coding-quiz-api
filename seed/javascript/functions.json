Variables and functions declared in a module are private by default and can only be accessed by other modules if they are explicitly exported.\n\nKey characteristics of module scope:\n\n1.  Variables declared in a module are scoped to that module only.\n2.  Each module has its own top-level scope\n3.  Variables and functions need to be explicitly exported to be used in other modules\n4.  The global scope cannot access module variables unless they are explicitly exported and imported\n5.  Modules are always executed in strict mode\n\n```javascript\n// moduleA.js\n\n// This variable is PRIVATE to moduleA. It's like a tool inside a closed box.\nconst privateVariable = \"I am private\";\n\n// This variable is PUBLIC because it's exported. Others can use it when they import moduleA.\nexport const publicVariable = \"I am public\";\n\n// PUBLIC function because it's exported. But it can still access privateVariable inside moduleA.\nexport function publicFunction() {\n  console.log(privateVariable); // ✅ This works because we're inside the same module.\n  return \"Hello from publicFunction!\";\n}\n\n// moduleB.js\n\n// Importing PUBLIC items from moduleA.\nimport { publicVariable, publicFunction } from \"./moduleA.js\";\n\nconsole.log(publicVariable); // ✅ \"I am public\" - Works because it's exported.\nconsole.log(publicFunction()); // ✅ \"Hello from publicFunction!\" - Works as well.\n\n// ❌ This will cause an ERROR because privateVariable was NOT exported from moduleA.\n// console.log(privateVariable);   // ❌ ReferenceError: privateVariable is not defined\n```\n\nCommon use cases and benefits:\n\n- Encapsulation of module-specific code\n- Prevention of global scope pollution\n- Better code organization and maintenance\n- Explicit dependency management\n- Protection of private implementation details\n\n475."

The inner variable shadows the outer one — meaning, the inner variable takes precedence in its own scope.\n\n     Let's take an example where the inner `a` inside `func()` shadows the outer variable `a`.\n\n      ```javascript\n      let a = 10;\n\n      function func() {\n        let a = 20; // Shadows the outer 'a'\n        console.log(a); // 20\n      }\n\n      func();\n      console.log(a); // 10\n      ```\n\n     **Illegal shadowing** in JavaScript refers to a syntax error that happens when you try to declare a block-scoped variable (`let` or `const`) with the same name as a variable declared using `var` in the same or an overlapping scope. \n\n     For example, if you declare both block-scoped variable and function scoped variable using the same name inside a function causes an illegal shadowing.\n\n      ```javascript\n      function test() {\n        var a = 10;\n        let a = 20; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared\n      }\n      ```\n    \n      As an another example, if you declare a variable with `let` or `const` in an outer scope, and then try to redeclare it with `var` inside a nested block, JavaScript throws an error — even though `var` is supposed to be function-scoped. Since the var appears in a block, it ends up trying to overwrite the `let` in the outer scope, which causes a conflict.\n\n      ```javascript\n      let a = 10;\n      {\n        var a = 20; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared\n        console.log(a);\n      }\n      ```\n\n476."
