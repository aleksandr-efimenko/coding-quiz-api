This way it prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions. The literal expression `\"use strict\";` instructs the browser to use the javascript code in the Strict mode.

      "explanation": "Module scope is a feature introduced with ES6 (ES2015) modules that creates a scope specific to a module file, isolating variables and functions declared within it from the global scope and other modules. Variables and functions declared in a module are private by default and can only be accessed by other modules if they are explicitly exported.\n\nKey characteristics of module scope:\n\n1.  Variables declared in a module are scoped to that module only.\n2.  Each module has its own top-level scope\n3.  Variables and functions need to be explicitly exported to be used in other modules\n4.  The global scope cannot access module variables unless they are explicitly exported and imported\n5.  Modules are always executed in strict mode\n\n```javascript\n// moduleA.js\n\n// This variable is PRIVATE to moduleA. It's like a tool inside a closed box.\nconst privateVariable = \"I am private\";\n\n// This variable is PUBLIC because it's exported. Others can use it when they import moduleA.\nexport const publicVariable = \"I am public\";\n\n// PUBLIC function because it's exported. But it can still access privateVariable inside moduleA.\nexport function publicFunction() {\n  console.log(privateVariable); // \u2705 This works because we're inside the same module.\n  return \"Hello from publicFunction!\";\n}\n\n// moduleB.js\n\n// Importing PUBLIC items from moduleA.\nimport { publicVariable, publicFunction } from \"./moduleA.js\";\n\nconsole.log(publicVariable); // \u2705 \"I am public\" - Works because it's exported.\nconsole.log(publicFunction()); // \u2705 \"Hello from publicFunction!\" - Works as well.\n\n// \u274c This will cause an ERROR because privateVariable was NOT exported from moduleA.\n// console.log(privateVariable);   // \u274c ReferenceError: privateVariable is not defined\n```\n\nCommon use cases and benefits:\n\n- Encapsulation of module-specific code\n- Prevention of global scope pollution\n- Better code organization and maintenance\n- Explicit dependency management\n- Protection of private implementation details\n\n**[\u2b06 Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n475.",

      "explanation": "Both **shadowing** and **illegal shadowing** refer to how variable names can \"hide\" or override others within nested scopes.\n\n     **Shadowing** occurs when a variable declared within a certain scope (like a function or block) has the same name as a variable declared in an outer scope. The inner variable shadows the outer one \u2014 meaning, the inner variable takes precedence in its own scope.\n\n     Let's take an example where the inner `a` inside `func()` shadows the outer variable `a`.\n\n      ```javascript\n      let a = 10;\n\n      function func() {\n        let a = 20; // Shadows the outer 'a'\n        console.log(a); // 20\n      }\n\n      func();\n      console.log(a); // 10\n      ```\n\n     **Illegal shadowing** in JavaScript refers to a syntax error that happens when you try to declare a block-scoped variable (`let` or `const`) with the same name as a variable declared using `var` in the same or an overlapping scope. \n\n     For example, if you declare both block-scoped variable and function scoped variable using the same name inside a function causes an illegal shadowing.\n\n      ```javascript\n      function test() {\n        var a = 10;\n        let a = 20; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared\n      }\n      ```\n    \n      As an another example, if you declare a variable with `let` or `const` in an outer scope, and then try to redeclare it with `var` inside a nested block, JavaScript throws an error \u2014 even though `var` is supposed to be function-scoped. Since the var appears in a block, it ends up trying to overwrite the `let` in the outer scope, which causes a conflict.\n\n      ```javascript\n      let a = 10;\n      {\n        var a = 20; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared\n        console.log(a);\n      }\n      ```\n**[\u2b06 Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n476.",

But the conditional has another local variable `count` which overwrites the ourter `count` variable. So the first console.log displays value 11.\nWhereas the second console.log logs 10 by capturing the count variable from outerscope.\n\n</p>\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n**[\u2b06 Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**",
