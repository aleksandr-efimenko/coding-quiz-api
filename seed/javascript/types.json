      "explanation": "The **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** refers to the period between the start of a block and the point where a variable declared with `let` or `const` is initialized. During this time, the variable exists in scope but **cannot be accessed**, and attempting to do so results in a `ReferenceError`.\n    \n    This behavior is part of **JavaScript's ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)** specification and applies **only to variables declared with `let` and `const`**, not `var`. Variables declared with `var` are **hoisted** and initialized with `undefined`, so accessing them before the declaration does not throw an error, though it can lead to unexpected results.",

Execution of other scripts\n     4. The environment variables\n\n     \n\n413.",
