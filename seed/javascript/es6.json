      "explanation": "The keyword `let` was chosen because it originates from mathematical notation, where \"let\" is used to introduce new variables (for example, \"let x = 5\"). This term was adopted by several early programming languages such as Scheme and BASIC, establishing a tradition in computer science. JavaScript follows this convention by using `let` to declare variables with block scope, providing a modern alternative to `var`. The choice helps make the language more familiar to programmers coming from other languages and aligns with the mathematical practice of variable assignment.\n\n    **[\u2b06 Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n21.",

      "text": "How do you redeclare variables in a switch block without an error",
      "explanation": "When you try to redeclare variables using `let` or `const` in multiple `case` clauses of a `switch` statement, you will get a SyntaxError. This happens because, in JavaScript, all `case` clauses within a `switch` statement share the same block scope. For example:\n    \n    ```javascript\n    let counter = 1;\n    switch (x) {\n      case 0:\n        let name;\n        break;\n      case 1:\n        let name; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared\n        break;\n    }\n    ```\n    \n    To avoid this error, you can create a new block scope within each `case` clause by wrapping the code in curly braces `{}`. This way, each `let` or `const` declaration is scoped only to that block, and redeclaration errors are avoided:\n    \n    ```javascript\n    let counter = 1;\n    switch (x) {\n      case 0: {\n        let name;\n        // code for case 0\n        break;\n      }\n      case 1: {\n        let name; // No SyntaxError\n        // code for case 1\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n    \n    That means, to safely redeclare variables in different cases of a switch statement, wrap each case\u2019s code in its own block using curly braces. This ensures each variable declaration is scoped to its specific case block.\n    \n    **[\u2b06 Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n22.",
